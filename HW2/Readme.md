# Attractiveness Predictor
The attractiveness will be scored in 5-point Likert scale:
  1. Very Low : the headline can not provide enough information nor literally attract attention. (seldom)
  2. Low : the headline is dull and flat.
  3. Moderate : the headline is embellished with rhetoric to increase variety.
  4. High : the headline is embellished and constructed in special way to arouse the interest.
  5. Very High : the headline is well-refined to intrigue the curiosity. (seldom)
